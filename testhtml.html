        <h3>About us</h3>

        <p>We are grade 11 IBDP students working collaboratively on our CSP Group 1 project. 
            Our aim is to explore and reflect upon the nuances of making fertilizers from 
            acid rain, delving into its implications through analytical and creative 
            approaches. This website serves as a platform to showcase our research, 
            ideas, and outcomes, reflecting our dedication to critical thinking and 
            effective communication. </p>

        <h3> Why?</h3>

        <p>Acid rain poses significant environmental and ecological challenges, 
            primarily due to its high acidity, which results from the atmospheric 
            reaction of pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. When 
            deposited, acid rain alters soil chemistry, leaching essential nutrients 
            and disrupting plant growth. It also harms aquatic ecosystems by acidifying 
            water bodies, leading to a decline in biodiversity. Furthermore, acid rain 
            accelerates the deterioration of buildings and monuments, causing economic 
            damage. Our project highlights the importance of addressing these issues by 
            not only mitigating the effects of acid rain but also transforming it into a 
            resource for agriculture. This approach underscores the potential to turn 
            environmental challenges into opportunities for sustainable development.</p>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on creating an innovative fertilizer by harnessing 
            acid rain, a pressing environmental issue. Using electrolysis, we extract 
            nitric acid from acid rain, which is then neutralized with ammonia to form 
            a practical and sustainable fertilizer. This hands-on approach not only 
            addresses the environmental impacts of acid rain but also demonstrates how 
            science can provide resourceful solutions to real-world challenges. Through 
            this project, we aim to merge scientific principles with creativity to 
            contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>By applying the 5 key science concepts, we have 
            created a project that not only addresses environmental 
            challenges but also offers a practical solution. Through 
            the electrolysis of acid rain, we have successfully produced 
            fertilizer and hydrogen fuel, utilizing the byproducts of 
            this process in a way that benefits the environment. This 
            project contributes to several Sustainable Development Goals 
            (SDGs), including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</li>
            <li>SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
            <li>SDG 13: Climate Action</li>
            <li>SDG 15: Life on Land</li>
        </ul>

        <p>During our experiment, we noticed some interesting results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electrolysis Efficiency: The electrolysis process 
                worked well, separating hydrogen gas and nitric acid 
                clearly. However, the amount of acid produced depended 
                on the voltage and the concentration of the electrolyte 
                we used.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>Ammonia Neutralization: Adding ammonia to the nitric 
                acid solution caused a noticeable reaction. The pH 
                shifted slightly, and the resulting fertilizer was 
                stable with only a mild smell, showing the 
                neutralization was successful.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>Final Product: The fertilizer worked well when tested 
                on small plants, which showed healthy growth after a 
                few days. We also collected hydrogen gas during the 
                process, which could potentially be used as a clean 
                energy source, though more testing would be needed to 
                confirm its effectiveness.</li>
        </ul>
